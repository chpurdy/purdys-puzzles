## January 2025 Puzzle

2025 is a perfect square a year (45 squared).  There are 5 perfect square dates in 2025 when written
`MMDDYYYY`.  The first of these is January 9 (`1092025 = 1045^2`).


Let's call a **moment** what we get if we add the precise time (to the nearest second) on a given date as `MMDDYYYYHHMMSS`.
(For hours, use 24-hour military time, ie. 3:00pm = 15:00)

The first perfect square moment of this year is precisely midnight January 9, 2025 (`1092025000000 = 1045000^2`).
The second perfect square moment is on February 26 at 2:40:09 AM (`2262025024009=1504003`).

What is the sum of all of the perfect square moments in the year 2025?
