# October Puzzle
```
The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

If we write these numbers in octal, they are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, and 15.

2, 3, 5, 7, and 13 are all prime numbers when written in base 10, but 15 is not.

We will call numbers that behave like this "October Primes"

17 is NOT an October Prime, since 17 in octal is 21 (which is not a prime number in base 10).

19 IS an October Prime, since 19 in octal is 23 (which is a prime number in base 10).

6 of the first 10 prime numbers are October Primes.
12 of the first 31 prime numbers are October Primes.
242 of the first 1031 prime numbers are October Primes.

How many of the first 103124 prime numbers are October Primes?
